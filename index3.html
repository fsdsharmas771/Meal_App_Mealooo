        <p>To make this delicious punjabi achari baingan sabji we need following ingerdients. Around 6-8 small baingan/brinjals, chopped onion, chopped tomatoes, finely chopped ginger and garlic (or paste), curry leaves. And we will also need few Indian spices usually used in pickles such as nigela seeds (onion seeds)/kalonji, fenugreek seeds (methi), fennel seeds (saunf). Apart from these spices we will also use some Indian dry spices like turmeric powder and red chili powder. Please refer the recipe box at the end of this post for complete list of ingredients with their quantities.</p>
        <p>Wash the baingan/brinjal and cut them into halves. Now heat oil in a frying pan and deep fry the baingans until they turn golden brown.Occasionally flip the baingans so that they cook evenly across both the sides. Once fried, drain the excess oil and take the fried baingan in a bowl.The baingan are fried now. Lets prepare the gravy for punjabi achaari baingan sabji.Now this heat oil in a skillet/pan and once the oil is hot, add grated ginger & garlic (or paste).
